  hosts: all

# vars is the key we are using and -name: demo.... is something we can give or escape as our wish
# in ansible variables will be accessed using {{}}
#  ansible supports "" and '' however quotes are not mandotroy in all cases
# but quotes are mandatory if value starts with a variable
# example for that is - msg: {{}} ---> this doesnt require quoting
# msg -URL - {{ URL }} ----> this doesnt require quoting
